# Rules (Web Admin - Vue)

Keep this file short and strict. Add project-specific details as you go.

## Conventions
- New features must follow existing patterns in this repo.
- Do not bypass shared request/http utilities.

## Structure
- UI code stays in the web app folder; do not mix backend code into frontend.
- Shared types live in a shared folder/package (if present).

## AI Constraints
- Do not invent APIs/files. Ask if unsure.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
