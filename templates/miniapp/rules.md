# Rules (Mini App)

## Conventions
- Keep pages lightweight; move logic into services/utilities where possible.
- Use the project's existing request wrapper and error handling.

## Structure
- Keep platform-specific files in the miniapp folder only.
- Do not duplicate constants/enums; prefer a shared source if available.

## AI Constraints
- Do not invent APIs/files. Ask if unsure.
- Keep changes small and testable on device/simulator.
