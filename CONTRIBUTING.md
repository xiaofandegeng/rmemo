# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to `rmemo`.

## Dev Setup

Requirements:
- Node.js >= 18

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## What To Work On

Good first contributions:
- Improve scan heuristics (monorepo/subprojects/api contracts) without hardcoding to one framework
- Improve `check` output formatting and fix hints
- Add more safe default rules/templates for common project types

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused and small.
- Add/adjust tests in `test/` when behavior changes.
- If you change CLI flags/commands, update both `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md`.
